## ü§î What is This Project?

### Simple Explanation
Imagine you have a house with many doors and windows. You want to know:
- Who is trying to break in?
- What suspicious activities are happening?
- How to automatically lock doors when danger is detected?

This project is like a **smart security guard** for computer networks that:
- **Watches** for cyber attacks 24/7
- **Detects** when hackers try to break in
- **Alerts** you immediately when something bad happens
- **Automatically responds** to stop the attacks

### What Does SOC Mean?
**SOC** = **Security Operations Center**
- It's like a control room where security experts monitor computer networks
- Our project creates a mini SOC that you can run on your computer
- It shows everything in a beautiful web dashboard

### What Technologies Are Used?
- **Python Flask** - Creates the website (like building blocks for web pages)
- **SQLite Database** - Stores all the security information (like a digital filing cabinet)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Makes the website look pretty and interactive
- **Chart.js** - Creates beautiful graphs and charts

## üíª Understanding the Code

### Database Structure (Simple Explanation)

#### Logs Table - The Diary
```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique number for each entry
    timestamp DATETIME,               -- When it happened
    source TEXT,                      -- Where it came from (Firewall, System, etc.)
    message TEXT,                     -- What happened
    severity TEXT                     -- How serious it is (info, warning, error)
);
```

#### Alerts Table - The Problem List
```sql
CREATE TABLE alerts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique number for each alert
    timestamp DATETIME,               -- When the problem was found
    threat_type TEXT,                 -- What kind of problem
    severity TEXT,                    -- How serious (high, medium, low)
    description TEXT,                 -- Details about the problem
    status TEXT                       -- Is it fixed or still active?
);
```

#### Responses Table - The Solution List
```sql
CREATE TABLE responses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique number for each response
    alert_id INTEGER,                 -- Which problem this fixes
    action TEXT,                      -- What action was taken
    timestamp DATETIME                -- When the action was taken
);
```

### How the Real-Time Updates Work

#### Background Thread (Like a Robot Worker)
```python
def generate_normal_logs():
    while True:
        time.sleep(random.randint(3, 8))  # Wait 3-8 seconds
        log_msg = random.choice(normal_logs)  # Pick a random log message
        add_log('SYSTEM', log_msg, 'info')    # Save it to database
```

**What this does:** Continuously creates new security events to simulate a real network

#### Frontend Updates (Like a News Ticker)
```javascript
setInterval(updateStats, 3000);      // Update statistics every 3 seconds
setInterval(loadLogs, 2000);         // Update logs every 2 seconds
setInterval(loadAlerts, 3000);       // Update alerts every 3 seconds
```

**What this does:** Automatically refreshes the website with new information

### How Threat Simulation Works

#### Step 1: User Clicks Button
```javascript
function simulateThreat(threatType) {
    // Show visual feedback
    card.classList.add('detected');
    
    // Send request to server
    fetch(`/api/simulate/${threatType}`)
}
```

#### Step 2: Server Processes Request
```python
@app.route('/api/simulate/<threat_type>')
def simulate_threat(threat_type):
    scenario = threat_scenarios[threat_type]
    
    # Add logs to database
    for log_msg in scenario['logs']:
        add_log('FIREWALL', log_msg, 'warning')
    
    # Create alert
    alert_id = add_alert(scenario['name'], scenario['severity'], scenario['description'])
```

#### Step 3: Frontend Shows Results
```javascript
// Refresh data after simulation
setTimeout(() => {
    loadLogs();
    loadAlerts();
    updateStats();
}, 1500);
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Problem: "Can't connect to database"
**Solution:**
1. Run `python database_setup.py` first
2. Make sure you're in the correct folder
3. Check if `soc_database.db` file exists

#### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution:**
1. Close any other programs using port 5000
2. Or change the port in `run.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`

#### Problem: "Charts not showing"
**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection (Chart.js loads from internet)
2. Wait a few seconds for data to load
3. Refresh the page

#### Problem: "Buttons not working"
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Make sure the server is running
3. Try refreshing the page

#### Problem: "Unicode/Emoji errors on Windows"
**Solution:**
This is already fixed in the code - emojis are replaced with text like [OK] and [ERROR]

### How to Check if Everything is Working

#### 1. **Database Check**
Look for these files in your project folder:
- `soc_database.db` (should exist after running database_setup.py)

#### 2. **Server Check**
When you run `python run.py`, you should see:
```
[SHIELD] CyberSecure SOC - AI/ML Threat Detection System
[OK] Database initialized successfully!
[START] Starting Flask application...
[INFO] Dashboard will be available at: http://localhost:5000
```

#### 3. **Website Check**
Open `http://localhost:5000` and verify:
- Statistics cards show numbers
- Threat detection cards have buttons
- Charts are visible
- Live activity feed shows events
- Clicking buttons creates notifications

#### 4. **Real-Time Check**
Leave the page open and watch for:
- Numbers changing automatically
- New log entries appearing
- Charts updating with new data
